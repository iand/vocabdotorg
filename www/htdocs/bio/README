This project contains the source schema for the RDF Schema at http://vocab.org/bio/0.1/

I am sharing the schema in github so others can contribute edits and improvements. It is an experiment to see how well a service like github can work for collaboratively managing schemas.

To edit the schema, clone the repository, make your changes, check to make sure your change results in valid RDF (and says what you think you're saying) using a tool like rapper (http://librdf.org/raptor/rapper.html).

If you are satisfied with your edits, send me a pull request (http://help.github.com/pull-requests/) I'll consider merging and publishing to vocab.org

(Inspiration for this approach comes from https://github.com/rsinger/LinkedMARCCodes)
