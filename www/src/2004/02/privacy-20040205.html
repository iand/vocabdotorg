			<dd>We make no effort to identify public users of our site. No 
identifying data is disclosed to any third party for any purpose. Data
 that we collect is used only for server administration.</dd>

		<p>This statement applies to interactions with the vocab.org 
Web servers. Any questions regarding the web site and the privacy 
 policy can be directed to privacy@vocab.org. </p>

		<p>As is typical, we log http requests to our server. This means that
 we know the originating IP (e.g. 18.29.0.1) address of a user agent 
 requesting a URL. We also know the Referer and User-Agent information
 accompanied with an HTTP request. We do not log the specific identity
	 of visitors. We occasionally analyze the log files to determine which 
 files are most requested and the previous site or user agent which 
 prompted the request. Our logging is passive; we do not use 
	 technologies such as cookies to maintain any information on users.</p>

		<p>Logged information is kept indefinitely as admistrative and research 
 material; it is not disclosed outside of vocab.org host site personnel. 
 Aggregate (completely non-identifying) statistics generated from these 
 logs may be reported as part of research results.</p>
