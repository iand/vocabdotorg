	<title>Job Application Example of Lifecycle Ontology</title>
	
</head>

<body>
	<p>
		The following example (in Turtle) describes the lifecycle of a job application.
	</p><p>
		We have an applicant, a foaf agent:
	</p>
	<pre>
		@prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/&gt;

		&lt;http://example.com/foaf/geoff&gt;
			a foaf:Person;
			foaf:name "Geoff Foo".
	</pre>
	<p>
		Geoff has applied for a job at example.com and his application has been received:
	</p>
	<pre>
		@prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;
		@prefix lifecycle: &lt;http://purl.org/vocab/lifecycle/schema#&gt;
		@prefix job: &lt;http://example.com/schemas/job-application/schema#&gt;
		@prefix jobApplication: &lt;http://example.com/lifecycles/job-application#&gt;

		&lt;http://example.com/jobs/application-12997&gt;
			rdfs:label "Job application from Geoff Foo";
			a job:Application;
			job:applicant &lt;http://example.com/foaf/geoff&gt;;
			lifecycle:state jobApplication:Received.
	</pre>
	<p>His application is being stored using a very basic example ontology:</p>
	<pre>
		@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;
		@prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;
		@prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/&gt;
		@prefix job: &lt;http://example.com/schemas/job-application/schema#&gt;

		job:Application
			a rdfs:Class;
			rdfs:Label &quot;A class representing an application for a job&quot;.

		job:applicant
			a rdf:Property;
			rdfs:Label &quot;A foaf agent who is applying for a job&quot;;
			rdfs:domain job:Application;
			rdfs:range foaf:Agent.
	</pre>
	<p>
		We can see from the snippet for Geoff's application that his application is the "Received" state. Actions are already underway to process it:
	</p>
	<pre>
		@prefix lifecycle: &lt;http://purl.org/vocab/lifecycle/schema#&gt;
		@prefix jobApplication: &lt;http://example.com/lifecycles/job-application#&gt;

		&lt;http://example.com/actions/124353648593626818&gt;
			a lifecycle:Action;
			lifecycle:resource &lt;http://example.com/jobs/application-12997&gt;;
			lifecycle:task jobApplication:confirmRightToWork;
			lifecycle:taskProgress lifecycle:Completed.

		&lt;http://example.com/actions/985637ahj7826127y&gt;
			a lifecycle:Action;
			lifecycle:resource &lt;http://example.com/jobs/application-12997&gt;;
			lifecycle:task jobApplication:checkForPreviousApplications;
			lifecycle:taskProgress lifecycle:Started.
	</pre>
	<p>
		The state of Geoff's application, and the actions that have taken place to process it thus far have been specified using the Lifecycle ontology. The specification of the job application process looks like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;
@prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;

@prefix job: &lt;http://example.com/schemas/job-application/schema#&gt;
